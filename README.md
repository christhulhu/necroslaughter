# NecroSlaughter.de - Backup

This repository is the backup of the deceased webzine NecroSlaughter.de. The domain is no longer valid. And at this place the content should be conserved.

You may feel free to browse through the archives here, read the texts. Or to clone this repository and build the site for more eye-candy and visual pleasure.

## Building

Just check this repo out, change into its root directory and build with [Hugo](https://hugo.io).

## Known Issues

NecroSlaughter.de run on Wordpress.org. But to archive its remains, I converted all content into markdown files that may be buildable with Hugo.io.
But I never really finished the work of this migration. So all content is available as flat files. But the compiled site still is ugly, buggy and totally not functionable. Feel free to correct this. Otherwhise just enjoy the plain text versions of all my writings 2006-2018. Maybe I'll add the early years 2003-2006 anytime...
